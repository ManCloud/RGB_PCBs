Console video cable connector PCBs

The user [Arcade TV](https://circuit-board.de/forum/index.php/User/1861-ArcadeTV/) in the Circuit-Board community once created the first ["VSAB"s -> Vertical SCART Adaper Boards](https://circuit-board.de/forum/index.php/Thread/14997-VSAB-Vertical-Scart-Adapter-Boards-outdated/).

In 2020 he found a Post by viletim mentioning, that it's better to have the additional components on console end of the cable instead of the TV end.
So i decided to invent a PCB which would make it easier to solder these cables inspired by the VSABs but for the console end.

As the VSAB boards then no longer needed any components (alsmost) i changed them a bit as well.
